I call myself <b>Data Enthusiast</b>, however I enjoy working with <b>computer technologies</b> in general.
My projects help users to have the best possible experience interacting with their data.
To do so I leverage available tools and create a meaningful <b>data foundation</b>.

This includes comprehensive analysis, improving data quality, data availability and integrity, as well as visualization and user-friendly interface development.
